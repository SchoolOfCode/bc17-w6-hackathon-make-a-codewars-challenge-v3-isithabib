## How To Play
Ok so you're finally home with your items. I hope you didn't pick up anything outside of the budget! Since you're so particular about your fridge, it's good to keep track of which new items you nought and how many of each item you have.
Where shall we start?
### Step 1
Have a look at the 2 arrays in the main.js file. The first array shows how you reorganised your existing items in the fridge. The second is the list of new items that you just bought.
### Step 2
To start storing your food in the correct area. The first thing you need to do is match the categeories.
Write a section of code to iterate through the food categories in your newFoods array to match them to your existingFoods array.
### Step 3
You should also add an error message that will appear when any of the categories do not match.
### Step 4
Once you've matched the categories, the next thing you need to do is iterate through the items in each category.

You'll need this because you don't want a repeat item in your fridge. If you find a matching item, you just want the quatoty to update.

You'll probably need an if else statement for this
### Step 3
console.log your existing foods array when you think you're done.

You should see the existing foods array updated with the items from your new foods array with no repeat items or new categories.

### Well done!
You've managed to do a task that most other functioning adults can do. I hope you're proud. Give yourself a pat on the back luv!
